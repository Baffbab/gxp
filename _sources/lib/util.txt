        will be called with the storage object passed to all other
        functions.
    :arg scope: ``Object`` Optional object to be set as the scope of all
        functions called.
    
    Allows multiple asynchronous sequences to be called in parallel.  A
    final callback is called when all other sequences report that they
    are done.
