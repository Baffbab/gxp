Config Options
--------------

Configuration properties in addition to
those listed for `Ext.util.Observable <http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.util.Observable>`_.


.. describe:: actions

    ``Array`` Custom actions for tools that do not provide their own. Array
    elements are expected to be valid Ext config objects. Actions provided
    here may have an additional ``menuText`` property, which will be used
    as text when the action is used in a menu. The ``text`` property will
    only be used in buttons. Optional, only needed to create custom
    actions.

.. describe:: actionTarget

    ``String`` or ``Array`` Where to place the tool's actions (e.g. buttons
    or menus)? This can be any string that references an ``Ext.Container``
    property on the portal, or a unique id configured on a component, or an
    array of the aforementioned if the action is to be put in more than one
    places (e.g. a button and a context menu item). To reference one of the
    toolbars of an ``Ext.Panel``, ".tbar", ".bbar" or ".fbar" has to be
    appended. The default is "map.tbar". The viewer's main MapPanel
    can always be accessed with "map" as actionTarget. Set to null if no
    actions should be created.

.. describe:: appendActions

    ``Boolean`` If set to false, actions won't be added, but inserted to
    the container at the beginning. This is useful to control the order of
    actions in a toolbar. Default is true.

.. describe:: autoActivate

    ``Boolean`` Set to false if the tool should be initialized without
    activating it. Default is true.

.. describe:: defaultAction

    ``Number`` Optional index of an action that should be active by
    default. Only works for actions that are a ``GeoExt.Action`` instance.

.. describe:: infoActionTip

    ``String``
    Text for feature info action tooltip (i18n).

.. describe:: outputAction

    ``Number`` The ``actions`` array index of the action that should
    trigger this tool's output. Only valid if ``actions`` is configured.
    Leave this unconfigured if none of the ``actions`` should trigger this
    tool's output.

.. describe:: outputConfig

    ``Object`` Optional configuration for the output container. This may
    be useful to override the xtype (e.g. "window" instead of "gx_popup"),
    or to provide layout configurations when rendering to an
    ``outputTarget``.

.. describe:: outputTarget

    ``String`` Popups created by this tool are added to the map by default.

.. describe:: popupTitle

    ``String``
    Title for info popup (i18n).

.. describe:: toggleGroup

    ``String`` If this tool should be radio-button style toggled with other
    tools, this string is to identify the toggle group.
