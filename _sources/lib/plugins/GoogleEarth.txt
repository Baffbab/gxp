ptype
    ``gxp_googleearth``



.. class:: GoogleEarth(config)

  Provides an action for switching between normal map view and
  Google Earth view.



Example Use
-----------

This tool can only be used if ``portalItems`` of :class:`gxp.Viewer` is set up
in the following way (or similar, the requirement is to have a panel with a card
layout which has 2 items: the map and the Google Earth panel):

.. code-block:: javascript

    portalItems: [{
        region: "center",
        layout: "border",
        border: false,
         items: [{
             xtype: "panel",
             id: "panel",
             tbar: [],
             layout: "card",
             region: "center",
             activeItem: 0,
             items: [
             "map", {
                 xtype: 'gxp_googleearthpanel',
                 mapPanel: "map"
             }
         ]
    }

hen make sure the tools go into the tbar of the panel, instead of the
map.tbar" which is the default, an example is:

.. code-block:: javascript

  tools: [
      {
          actionTarget: "panel.tbar",
          ptype: "gxp_googleearth",
          apiKey: 'ABQIAAAAeDjUod8ItM9dBg5_lz0esxTnme5EwnLVtEDGnh-lFVzRJhbdQhQBX5VH8Rb3adNACjSR5kaCLQuBmw'
      }
  ]

    


Config Options
--------------

Configuration properties in addition to
those listed for `Ext.util.Observable <http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.util.Observable>`_.


.. describe:: actions

    ``Array`` Custom actions for tools that do not provide their own. Array
    elements are expected to be valid Ext config objects. Actions provided
    here may have an additional ``menuText`` property, which will be used
    as text when the action is used in a menu. The ``text`` property will
    only be used in buttons. Optional, only needed to create custom
    actions.

.. describe:: actionTarget

    ``Object`` or ``String`` or ``Array`` Where to place the tool's actions
    (e.g. buttons or menus)?
    
    In case of a string, this can be any string that references an
    ``Ext.Container`` property on the portal, or a unique id configured on a
    component.
    
    In case of an object, the object has a "target" and an "index" property,
    so that the tool can be inserted at a specified index in the target.
    
    actionTarget can also be an array of strings or objects, if the action is
    to be put in more than one place (e.g. a button and a context menu item).
    
    To reference one of the toolbars of an ``Ext.Panel``, ".tbar", ".bbar" or
    ".fbar" has to be appended. The default is "map.tbar". The viewer's main
    MapPanel can always be accessed with "map" as actionTarget. Set to null if
    no actions should be created.
    
    Some tools provide a context menu. To reference this context menu as
    actionTarget for other tools, configure an id in the tool's
    outputConfig, and use the id with ".contextMenu" appended. In the
    snippet below, a layer tree is created, with a "Remove layer" action
    as button on the tree's top toolbar, and as menu item in its context
    menu:
    
    .. code-block:: javascript
    
       {
           xtype: "gxp_layertree",
           outputConfig: {
               id: "tree",
               tbar: []
           }
       }, {
           xtype: "gxp_removelayer",
           actionTarget: ["tree.tbar", "tree.contextMenu"]
       }
    
    If a tool has both actions and output, and you want to force it to
    immediately output to a container, set actionTarget to null. If you
    want to hide the actions, set actionTarget to false. In this case, you
    should configure a defaultAction to make sure that an action is active.

.. describe:: autoActivate

    ``Boolean`` Set to false if the tool should be initialized without
    activating it. Default is true.

.. describe:: controlOptions

    ``Object`` If this tool is associated with an ``OpenLayers.Control``
    then this is an optional object to pass to the constructor of the
    associated ``OpenLayers.Control``.

.. describe:: defaultAction

    ``Number`` Optional index of an action that should be active by
    default. Only works for actions that are a ``GeoExt.Action`` instance.

.. describe:: outputAction

    ``Number`` The ``actions`` array index of the action that should
    trigger this tool's output. Only valid if ``actions`` is configured.
    Leave this unconfigured if none of the ``actions`` should trigger this
    tool's output.

.. describe:: outputConfig

    ``Object`` Optional configuration for the output container. This may
    be useful to override the xtype (e.g. "window" instead of "gx_popup"),
    or to provide layout configurations when rendering to an
    ``outputTarget``.

.. describe:: outputTarget

    ``String`` Where to add the tool's output container? This can be any
    string that references an ``Ext.Container`` property on the portal, or
    "map" to access the viewer's main map. If not provided, a window will
    be created.

.. describe:: toggleGroup

    ``String`` If this tool should be radio-button style toggled with other
    tools, this string is to identify the toggle group.
