.. class:: ViewerField(config)

  A form field that holds an entire :class:`gxp.Viewer`. This field is used
  to process geospatial information in forms. By itself, this field does
  nothing but showing a map viewer in a form element, aligned with field
  label and suited for an ``Ext.layouts.FormLayout``.

  To actually have this field's textarea populated with information, a
  plugin accessing the additional ``field`` property that this component
  adds to its :class:`gxp.Viewer` instance is required.
  See :class:`gxp.plugins.FeatureToField` for a basic plugin that does
  this.
