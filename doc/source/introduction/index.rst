Motivation
==========
OpenLayers does a great job at providing a building block for a web mapping application, however there is a huge gap between a basic OpenLayers example and a full-blown web mapping application. 
Compare http://www.openlayers.org/dev/examples/google-ng.html with http://suite.opengeo.org/geoexplorer/composer and you'll get an idea of how big the gap is. This is where GXP fits in.

What is GXP?
============
GXP is a client-side only javascript library, built on top of OpenLayers, GeoExt and Ext JS. The purpose of GXP is twofold:

* creating web mapping applications should be as simple as providing JSON configuration
* creating an extensible framework in which it is easy to add new layers types and new tools etc.

What is ReadyGXP?
=================
ReadyGXP is a utility that helps you set up a development environment, allows you to build a static app for production, and can be used to provide simple back-end functionality (persistence, template rendering, etc.).
