.. _gxp.viewer.locale:

Changing the locale of the viewer
=================================
Say your target public is not an English speaking one but French speaking. How do you change the application to be in French?

Open up the file buildjs.cfg and go to the GeoExt section. Add the following::

    GeoExt/locale/GeoExt-fr.js

Go to the gxp section and add::

    locale/fr.js

Next, open up app.js and add:

.. code-block:: javascript

    GeoExt.Lang.set("fr");

Restart the web application using ant and reload your browser:

  .. figure:: gxp-img15.png
     :align: center
     :width: 1000px

Ofcourse, the static strings that you provided in app.js such as Layers and Map would need to be translated into French as well, but all the content which is being generated by gxp will be in French if it has a French translation available.
