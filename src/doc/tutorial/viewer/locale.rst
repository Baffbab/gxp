.. _sdk.viewer.locale:

Changing the locale of the viewer
=================================
Imagine your target audience not being English speaking but French speaking. How do you change the application to be in French?

Open up the file buildjs.cfg and go to the GeoExt section. Add the following::

    GeoExt/locale/GeoExt-fr.js

Go to the gxp section and add::

    locale/fr.js

Next, open up app.js and add:

.. code-block:: javascript

    GeoExt.Lang.set("fr");

Restart the web application using ant and reload your browser:

  .. figure:: gxp-img15.png
     :align: center
     :width: 1000px

Ofcourse, the static strings that you provided in app.js such as Layers and Map would need to be translated into French as well, but all the content which is being generated by gxp will be in French provided it has a French translation available.

In the next section we will look at more advanced topics such as :ref:`editing <sdk.editor>`.
