Boundless SDK Client API Reference
==================================

For information about **how to use** the Boundless SDK please refer to the Suite User Manual section on **webapps** located at `Suite > Building complete web applications <http://localhost:8080/opengeo-docs/webapps/>`_  or visit our `online Suite documentation <http://suite.opengeo.org/opengeo-docs/webapps/>`_.

The gxp components and data utility classes extend map related functionality to
equivalent classes in Ext.  The API reference here documents the properties,
methods, and events that are extensions or modifications to the Ext parent
classes.  Documentation for each class contains links to the Ext parent class,
and for a full picture of the API, it is essential to have a copy of the
`Ext API Documentation`_ at hand.

gxp classes are typically configured with OpenLayers or GeoExt objects.  For
detail on methods and properties provided by these objects, see the
`OpenLayers API Documentation`_ and `GeoExt API Documentation`_.
